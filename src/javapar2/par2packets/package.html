  Package containing the java representation of the par2 packets.
  <p>
      The package contain the generic packet, and the standard subtypes of it. 
      After having read a file into a ByteBuffer, feed the Buffer to the 
      UnparsedPacket constructor to load a packet. You can do this in a loop, to
      read all the packets stored in a file.<br>
      The contents of the packet are read in and stored, but they are not parsed
      in this process. Only the generic header is parsed.<br>
      Once the UnparsedPacket is made, the type can be determined, and it can be
      "cast" into one of the subtypes. In this process, the previously stored 
      content of the packet is parsed.<br>
      For more info on the structure of the packets, see
